## Project Highlights

### Student Enrollment & Secure Access
Students can easily enroll in their preferred courses through a user-friendly interface with secure authentication. Initial challenges with Stripe payment integration and image hosting were successfully resolved using online resources and documentation.

### Future Enhancements
We plan to implement **JWT authentication** to improve security and provide more precise control over user access and roles.

### User-Friendly Interface
A clean and simple UI ensures that users can find what they need quickly. The design is responsive and works smoothly on all devicesâ€”phones, tablets, and desktops.

### Filtering & Searching
Users can filter courses by category and search by course title, allowing them to quickly find relevant content. This improves overall navigation and helps users access desired courses efficiently.

### Dynamic Dashboards
eduSpark provides separate dashboards for each user role:
- **Students:** Enroll in courses, view progress, access enrolled content.
- **Instructors:** Add, manage, and track classes and student engagement.
- **Admins:** Monitor user activities, manage roles, and maintain system integrity.
